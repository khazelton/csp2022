` Focus on Grouper and midPoint. Have in AWS Dev. +
` Using Sailpoint a bit - not using all the features. +
`` Taking data from Workday to homegrown system Texas Identity Manager (TIM, Java based). 
`` This does provisioning to active directory.

` Immediate focus is replacing Sailpoint

` Wondering if they mirror Sailpoint and midPoint for a while?

` Or get rid of TIM first?

` Does midPoint have a connector to workday out of the box?

`` Not yet, but not the only one interested

`` If not, does it make sense to use midPoint?

` Want to contribute back to community.

`` Allured by Higher Ed community
